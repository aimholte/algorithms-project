# algorithms-project
A repo for our algorithms project.

data.py holds all our functions that we used for scraping the Morningstar API to grab stock price closing data for each
day in our time period. hedgeAlgorithm.py is where the hedge algorithm is implemented, along with some analysis and
visualization of the results. We also used RiskAdjustedReturnMetrics.py from
https://gist.github.com/StuartGordonReid/67a1ec4fbc8a84c0e856#file-riskadjustedreturnmetrics-py to help us analyze
the effectiveness of our algorithms based off industry-standard metrics used within the realms of finance.

We have included several photos of our graphs, which display our results along with our compiled datasets, and an Excel
spreadsheet (hedgeResults&Discussion.xlsx) that displays our result statistics along with a discussion.
